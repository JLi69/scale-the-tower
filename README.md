# Scale the Tower

This is my entry for the 2023 GitHub Game Off Jam (Theme: "Scale").

I decided to program my entry using Rust but I'm still fairly inexperienced
with programming in Rust and much of the code is likely not 
idiomatic/best practice/well organized but it's all licensed under the
Apache 2.0 license so feel free to do what you want with this game.

## How to play

Can you make it to the top of the Tower of Doom without dying a horrific death?

Attempt to get as high of a score as possible by collecting gold and defeating
enemies!

### Controls

 - Left / Right arrow keys = move around
 - Up arrow key = jump
 - Space = attack
 - 1 / 2 = switch between sword and bow

## Compile

```
cargo build --release
```
